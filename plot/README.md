# Plot
This folder provides the Python code to generate the plots in the paper. We provide the following two notebooks:

 * `biometic.ipynb`: computes the biometric deduplication error rate based on the sensors matching error rate and plots the failure to register probability for having single or fused templates.
 * `janus.ipynb`: process the raw performance measures of Janus and plot the performance of Hyb-Janus, SMC-Janus, and two related works namely Huang et al. and HERS.
